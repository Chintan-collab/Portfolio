The primary objective is to assess the feasibility of developing such an innovative system that empowers users to engage in seamless, conversational interactions with our extensive repository of documents related to user specific fund. This cutting-edge development promises to revolutionize the way users access information, transforming the tedious manual information retrieval process into an effortless and intuitive experience. </p> <h3>Objectives:</h3> <p>The primary goal of this project is to assess the feasibility of implementing the Retrieval Augmented Generation architecture with a central chatbot interface. Through rigorous testing and evaluation, we aim to: </p> <ul> <li>Validate the effectiveness of the chatbot in retrieving accurate and relevant information from our document repository. </li> <li>Gauge user satisfaction and usability through feedback and user interaction metrics. </li> <li>Identify potential challenges and limitations that need to be addressed for a full-scale deployment.</li> </ul> <p>Overall, auditing requires a lot of attention to detail, coordination, and compliance with regulations, making it a time-consuming and often tedious task.</p> <h3>Proposed Solution</h3> <p>As a visionary proposal, we harness the formidable fusion of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture and a commercially-empowered Large Language Model (LLM) to breathe life into a centrally accessible chatbot. This pioneering combination seamlessly melds the realms of information retrieval and content generation, granting users the remarkable ability to engage with the chatbot in a natural, human-like manner. Gone are the days of complex search queries; users can now effortlessly tap into the system's full potential by merely posing questions or specifying the information they desire. At its core, the LLM tirelessly handles the arduous tasks of information retrieval, delivering accuracy and speed in tandem.</p> <p>We've equipped this chatbot with filtering options providing all the documents names as multiselect, allowing users to guide the chatbot's search precisely, thwarting any tendencies to hallucinate and ensuring they receive the most up-to-date and relevant information available. It's a breakthrough that marries cutting-edge technology with user-centric precision.</p> <h3>Approach:</h3> <ul> <li>Our journey in developing this cutting-edge chatbot was guided by the nimble and adaptive principles of Agile methodology. We set our sights on delivering a foundational solution to the challenge at hand, with a clear intent to refine and expand as we progressed.</li> <li>The journey commenced with a crucial decision: selecting a vector store that perfectly aligned with our project's demands. After diligent research and scrutiny, I embraced Qdrant as our vector store of choice. Notably, Qdrant offered a free-tier cluster configuration that seamlessly met our needs. I embarked on embedding the documents related to the demo fund, employing the Huggingface embeddor, and stowing them away in a collection within the vector store.</li> <li>The next phase involved the inception of a conversational agent, equipped with the vector store as its trusty retriever. Furthermore, I endowed it with memory capabilities, enabling it to remember and enhance user interactions, elevating the overall experience.</li> <li>Our commitment to user-centricity drove us to implement a remarkable feature: the ability to introduce custom PDFs into the conversation. This feature, extending beyond the global scope, necessitated the creation of a robust logic for extracting, embedding, and storing these custom documents within the vector store.</li> <li>As the foundation was laid and the system took shape, the time was ripe to infuse our chatbot with filtering capabilities for the retriever, ensuring that users could precisely pinpoint the document they sought.</li> <li>An option for speech induced questioning was also implemented as a part of the process making it feasible for the user to question easily.</li> </ul> <h3>Feature Review</h3> <div class="video-container" style="width:81vw;height:80vh"> <video controls width="100%" height="100%"> <source src="CloudSync.c8ddad6b.mp4" type="video/mp4"> </video> </div> <br> <h3>Next Steps:</h3> <ul> <li>Our journey continues with unwavering determination as we chart the path to full-scale implementation of the chatbot, armed with the invaluable insights gleaned from the POC. This endeavor is poised to yield a truly robust and substantial product, one that promises to redefine user experiences and industry standards.</li> <li>To fortify our chatbot, we'll harness the unparalleled power of commercialized Large Language Models (LLMs) and the finest embeddor models available. This strategic choice will not only enhance the robustness of our product but also alleviate any restrictions, both from the user and developer perspectives. </li> <li>We shall diligently define and implement policies governing the creation, updation, and deletion of collections within our vector store. These policies will serve as the bedrock of our system, ensuring seamless data management and optimal efficiency.</li> </ul> <h3>Further Research and Development:</h3> <ul> <li><b>Enhancing LLM Precision:</b> Our quest to refine the user experience includes in-depth research on reducing LLM hallucinations and enhancing its precision when responding to queries that may not align with the available content. This pursuit of accuracy is at the core of our commitment to excellence.</li> <li><b>User Interaction:</b> To empower our users and streamline interactions, we will research on how to guide users effectively when engaging with the chatbot. We envision a future where users are provided with contextual suggestions, aligning with our pre-defined questions, thereby aiding users in framing their inquiries more clearly.</li> </ul> </section> </div> </div>  <footer id="footer"> <ul class="icons"> <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chintan-vekariya-633278190/" class="alt brands fa-linkedin-in icon"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span></a></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/Chintan-collab" class="alt brands fa-github icon"><span class="label">GitHub</span></a></li> <li><a href="mailto:chiintan.vekariya@gmail.com" class="alt fa-envelope icon solid"><span class="label">Email</span></a></li> </ul> </footer> </div>  <script src="index.471e94a0.js"></script> <script src="index.85c18fe2.js"></script> <script src="index.0d0f8b0f.js"></script> <script src="index.b9c269a9.js"></script> <script src="index.af0c9ec1.js"></script> <script src="index.820333a9.js"></script> <script src="index.06066817.js"></script> <script src="index.61ceb025.js"></script> </body></html>
